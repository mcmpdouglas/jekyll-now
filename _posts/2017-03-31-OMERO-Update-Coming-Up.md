---

![OMERO 5.3.0](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-artwork/omero-logos/omero-logo-400.png)

A [new version of OMERO](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.0/) with new features and upgrades is out now! I am planning to upgrade the server on **Friday, April 14th 2017**.  

You'll have to upgrade your OMERO Insight client to version 5.3.0 to connect to OMERO. **Your current version won't work anymore.** 

Also, there's a small but real risk of data loss during the update phase. Please make sure to backup your critical data before the update.

What you need to do:
----
1. Download a copy of your important data.
2. Download and install the [new version of the OMERO Insight client](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.0/).
3. If you are using the ImageJ plugin to connect to OMERO, make sure to [download the new plugin](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.0/artifacts/OMERO.insight-ij-5.3.0-ice36-b59.zip) and replace the old one.
4. Let me know if you have any issue, and enjoy!.



What's new in OMERO 5.3.0:

>* Improved support for many file formats 
>* Script improvements including ability to create tiled images from big ROIs
>* ROI Folders
>* New UI for displaying Screen Plate Well data
