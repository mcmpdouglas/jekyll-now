title: OMERO Update Coming Up
---

A [new version of OMERO](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.0/) with new features and upgrades is out now! I am planning to upgrade the server on **Friday, April 14th 2017**. The OMERO server will be **down** the whole day

You'll have to upgrade your OMERO Insight client to version 5.3.0 to connect to OMERO. **Your current version won't work anymore.** 

Also, there's a small but real risk of data loss during the update phase. Please make sure to backup your critical data before the update.

What you need to do:
----
**Before** Friday, April 14th:
1. Download a copy of your important data.

**After** Friday, April 14th:
1. Download and install the [new version of the OMERO Insight client](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.0/).
2. If you are using the ImageJ plugin to connect to OMERO, make sure to [download the new plugin](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.0/artifacts/OMERO.insight-ij-5.3.0-ice36-b59.zip) and replace the old one.
3. Let me know if you have any issue, and enjoy!.
