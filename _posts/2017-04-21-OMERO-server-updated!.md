title: The OMERO server has been updated, here's what you have to do.
---

Hey guys, the update went smoothly and the new updated OMERO server is ready to use! 

You can access the [web interface](http://mcmpsrv01/omero) right away if you are connected to the Douglas network. From there, you can access the updated the **[Figure app](http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/)!**

You will need to download and install the [new version of the OMERO.insight client](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.1/).

Please let me know if you have any issues!
