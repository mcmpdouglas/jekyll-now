title: Orbit, An Efficient Software to Analyze your Slide Scanner Images
---

Happy new year everyone!

I recently came across this cool little piece of open-source software, [Orbit](https://www.orbit.bio/).

It's an image analysis program that uses machine learning to find and measure features in images. The cool part of it is that it natively supports [OMERO](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero), which we have setup as the image server here at the Douglas. Orbit also support big images like those from our slide scanner. It has the power of making your analysis much simpler, check it out!
