title: Presentation about Fluorescence Microscopy on Monday October 17th
---

I've got a presentation next week on Monday October 17th at 11am, in the Bowermann Room (Douglas Hospital). I will go over the basics of fluorescence microscopy and
discuss the various techniques and applications of fluorescence microscopy. I will also briefly discuss image analysis and which software to use.

See you there!
