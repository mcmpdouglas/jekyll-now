title: OMERO now supports OIR files, easy opening in OMERO.figure
---

Hey guys,

I just updated OMERO to version 5.3.2. Now, OIR-format multiphoton images from our Olympus microscope can be imported directly! Thanks to the OMERO development team who actually built the feature using images taken here, at the Douglas!

Also, I configured the right-click menu in OMERO.web so that you can directly open an image in OMERO.figure! 

Try it out!
