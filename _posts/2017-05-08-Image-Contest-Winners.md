title: Winners of the Inauguration Day Image Contest
---

In March 2017, the MCMP officially became an **Olympus Discovery Center**. We organized an internal image contest together with Olympus Canada to celebrate our partnership. The results were announced back in March during the Inauguration Day. You might've missed them so here are the [**winners and finalists of the contest!**](http://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/mcmp-image-gallery)

Congrats to everyone who participated!
